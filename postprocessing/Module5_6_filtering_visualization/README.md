####  Program3_module_5.RMD 

##### Goal

Generate the final extraction table tailored to the case study knowledge gap

##### Description

`Program3_module_5` takes as input the extraction table and also the harmonized extraction table, which is the direct output of `Program2_module_4`. See `harmonized_extraction_table_sample.csv`

In **part (A)** checks the “extraction table” and examined it in detail. 

In **part (B)** checks the “harmonized extraction table”. 

In **part (C)** then takes the "harmonized extraction table" as input and, in a series of structured steps, review each key extraction element to filter NAs, remove redundancies, and tailor the dataset to the study’s focal gaps—biochar and the retention of crop residues versus soil fauna. The final output is the "final extraction table".

####  Program4_module_5.RMD 

##### Goal

Provide analysis and visualization plots of the final extraction table

##### Description 

`Program4_module_5.Rmd` checks the "final extraction table", describes the final results, and build the plots for visualization.
